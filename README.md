## Hello there! 👋🏻👩🏻‍💻

My name is _Marijke_, and it is pronounced Mah-Rye-Kuh. I am a freelance web developer from Groningen, The Netherlands.

I specialize in **Django, Python, HTML, and CSS**, with a sprinkle of JavaScript. I am also interested in **accessibility**.

PS. Apologies to those who just read my username in English and think it sounds NSFW: I didn't have the sense to check the pronunciation when I claimed it a million years ago.

### Some facts

* Like my name, my company is called **Mah-Rye-Kuh** ([Hire me](https://mah-rye-kuh.nl/en/hire-me/)).
* I am a member of the [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/individual-members/) (DSF).
* I am also a member of the **Django Accessibility Team**.
* Coffee is not my cup of tea. Tea, on the other hand…
